Rainfall
========

As part of my first year studies at the University of Lancaster I was required to build a rainfall data analysis program that could analysis text files produced by the local Hailrigg weather station in Lancaster; this obviously dramatically reduces the scope of the application unless similar stations format their data in a similar way. The application can be used to analize large volumes of information and calculate averages, totals, wettest and driest periods of time (years, months, days). You can also visualize the data in bar graph form over periods of time such as months and years.
